**Unit 4: The Romantic Craft: Poesis, Innovation, and Experiment** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will take a look at what it meant to be a writing
subject in the Romantic period, examining notions of authorship, poesis,
and tradition. We will consider with particular care the poet’s sense of
his own role in society - something that we may find rather unfamiliar
when compared to today’s understanding of the poetic craft as a
less-than-urgent art form.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 4 hours.

    statement suggest about the true social, political, and cultural
    power of artists?
