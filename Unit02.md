**Unit 2: Mindscapes, Moods, and the Inner World** <span id="2"></span> 
*In Unit 1, we attended to the Romantic poet’s figuration of the outer
world. We will now turn inward, discussing not only why the innermost
thoughts and feelings of the individual seemed so central to Romantic
poetry but we will also attend to the ways in which that inner life is
represented and figured in language.*
