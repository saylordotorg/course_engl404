*The Romantic Period in England spans the decades of the 1780’s through
the 1830’s. It was the* age of revolutions *- a span of time that saw
not only the rapid industrialization of Europe but two significant
national revolutions - one in France and one in America. This
revolutionary spirit in many ways fed and sustained the Romantic
Movement in English literature; its chief practitioners believed that
poetry could literally transform the world and the way in which we
understand it. In this course, we will examine this revolutionary energy
alongside a number of other English Romantic characteristics, including
a fascination with nature and the natural world; a desire to boldly
experiment, explore, and renew literature; and a focus on the
individual’s capacity for imagination and vision. First, we will discuss
the broader socio-historical and literary context in which English
Romantic poetry thrived. Second, we will examine the three main concerns
of English Romantic poets, which have been roughly divided among the
three course units: the Romantic poet and the outer world, the Romantic
poet and the inner world, and the poetry that bridges the gap between
those two. Third, we will closely examine several of the period’s
prominent poems, identifying what makes each a* Romantic *poem and how
these poems relate to the three concerns listed above.*
