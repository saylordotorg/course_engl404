**Unit 1: An Introduction to the Romantic Period and Its Poetry** <span
id="1"></span> 
*The Romantic period coincided with the industrialization of Britain and
dramatic* *popular revolutions in France and America - developments that
changed the way in which people conceived of themselves and their
relationships with their societies. Many awakened to the concepts of
self-determination and individual rights, turning away from the*
*Enlightenment model of subjectivity so as to include more elements of
man, such as imagination and emotion. Why the era was called*
Romantic *is heavily debated. Many scholars assert that the term*
Romantic *comes from the criticism that writers of this era were
constantly on a quest for* something*, often unnamed, which therefore
echoed the romances of the Middle Ages. Others believe that the word*
roman *refers to the French and German meanings of* new *or*
novel *since the writers of this period set out to create art that was
wholly new and unique.*  
    
 *In this unit, we will examine these social changes and the impact they
had on the development of English Romantic poetry. We will conclude with
an overview of English Romanticism - its principal characteristics,
practitioners, and conventions.*
