**Unit 3: Landscapes and the Outer World** <span id="3"></span> 
*The Romantic poet often situates his poetry in a natural setting,
delighting in its beauty and its awe-inspiring strength and wildness. In
this unit, we will take a more critical look at representations of the
natural world and at depictions of place and setting more generally,
from the cityscape to imagined exotic worlds of the past. We will
conclude by exploring poems that feature movement within those spaces,
discussing concepts of travel, imagination, exploration, and identity.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 13.25 hours.

     Instructions: Read stanzas 92 through 98 of the third canto in
    Byron’s work called *Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage*. How is nature

    (in the previous resource) and Wordsworth both depict nature as
    emblematic of man’s interiority. How does Wordsworth’s
    representation of nature in “Nutting” differ from Byron’s in *Childe
    Harold’s Pilgrimage*? Nature in “Nutting” seems to be more
    indicative of the consequence of a bad choice made by the poem’s
    speaker. What is this choice that the speaker makes? What
    differences are drawn between man and nature in Wordsworth’s poem?

    the First) of Byron’s long poem. What is the general mood of this

    autobiographical narrative poem, the speaker, weary of his life of
    leisure, sets out to a distant, foreign land of the past in search
    of escape and freedom. *Childe Harold* is widely considered to be

     Instructions: Read Coleridge’s poem. Many critics believe that this
    poem is unfinished, as Coleridge himself suggests, while other
    readers feel that it is, indeed, a finished and complete work. What
    do you think? Is the poem *finished* or is it simply a fragment of
    an unfinished poem? This famous poem takes us to an imagined,
    distant, and isolated land called Xanadu: the imagery is striking
    and conjures a sense of a hazy hallucination. The poem was written
    while Coleridge was heavily addicted to opium, and is considered by
    some critics to be an allegory of drug addiction as well as a
    portrait of a vivid opium hallucination.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: First, read *Childe Harold's Pilgrimage*, which you
    encountered earlier in this course. This is a long poem that charts
    the development of a central character and plots Byron's conception
    of the proper *hero* of literature. Next, read *Don Juan*. This is a
    satirical epic poem in which Byron plays with the convention of the
    epic, introducing his own colloquial style and toying with the
    traditional concept of the hero*.* Who is the narrator of *Don
    Juan*? How do his attitudes differ from Don Juan's? Why might Byron
    have chosen not to make *Don Juan* the narrator of his adventures
    like he did with Childe Harold? How do the personal and subjective
    elements of each hero develop into knowledge about the world in
    general? Is this *subjective* platform for understanding relevant to
    Romantic notions concerning knowledge and understanding in general?
    Do these notions conflict with the Enlightenment’s assumptions of
    knowledge as universal and unchanging?  
        
     Reading both poems should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Read Wordsworth’s poem. The speaker of the poem is
    revisiting an area he once visited years before, and is struck again
    by the power of nature before him. How does the speaker detail the
    lasting effects of these scenes of nature on him? How has the memory
    of the setting from years ago affected the speaker morally? How has
    the memory of the experience of nature been seen in his actions and
    behavior? What does such a moral development say about man and his
    relationship to nature?

     Instructions: Read Byron’s poem. As you read, consider these
    questions: What kind of apocalypse does this poet imagine? What
    brings about apocalypse in this poem? What kind of post-apocalyptic
    world is imagined in this poem? Does Byron’s vision of apocalypse
    remind you of any contemporary, popular descriptions of post-nuclear
    apocalypse?

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Percy Bysshe Shelley’s poem and consider the
    same questions you did when you read Byron’s poem (in the previous
    resource box). In addition, how does Shelley conceptualize titanic,
    apocalyptic events from the past impacting the future through his
    description of Ozymandias?  
        
     Reading this poem should take approximately 10 minutes.

-   **Reading: The Cambridge History of English and American
    Literature’s “Blake: The Urizen Group” and William Blake’s “The
    First Book of Urizen”**
    Links: The Cambridge History of English and American Literature’s
    “[Blake: The Urizen
    Group](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ENGL404-The-Urizen-Group.pdf)”
    (PDF) and William Blake’s “[The First Book of
    Urizen](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ENGL404-Blake-The-First-Book-of-Urizen.pdf)”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the introduction to William Blake as well as his
    poem. As you read, consider the same questions regarding apocalypse
    that you did for Byron and Shelley (in the previous resource boxes).
    In addition, what kind of figure/persona is Blake’s Urizen? How does
    Blake conceptualize the figure of Urizen in relation to apocalypse,
    destruction, and rebirth?  
        
     Note: All of the major English Romantic poets showed a particular
    interest in the apocalypse. Despite the idealism and fascination
    with the past that a number of Romantics demonstrate throughout
    their work, many of the English Romantic poets show a remarkable
    fascination with destruction and apocalypse. Given the excesses and
    radical changes brought about by the French Revolution, and
    incredible technological and cultural changes brought about by the
    18th century, the English Romantics were particularly aware of how
    easily the world could not only change but also be destroyed. Byron,
    Shelley, and Blake all imagine apocalypse in different ways and as
    coming from radically different sources. Moreover, these poets
    imagine the apocalypse as being not only likely but also inevitable.
    For Shelley and to some measure Blake and Byron, the apocalypse will
    not only serve to destroy previous political, social, and cultural
    orders but also usher in revolution, change, and the rebirth of
    civilization.
